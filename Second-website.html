        <h1 class="big-heading">Pakistan Independence Day.</h1>
        <p class="text">Independence Day, observed annually on 14 August, is a national holiday in Pakistan. It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj">British Raj</a> in 1947.</p>
        <p class="text2">Pakistan came into existence as a result of the Pakistan Movement, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in the north-western regions of South Asia via Partition. The movement was led by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League">All-India Muslim League</a> under the leadership of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a>.</p>

        <h1 class="big-heading">Background</h1>
        <p class="text">The East India Company begun their trade in South Asia in the 17th century, and the company rule started from 1757 when they won the Battle of Plassey. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control over much of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
        <p class="text2">The All India Muslim League was founded on December 30, 1906. There was growing demand for an independent Muslim state in India. In 1930 Muhammad Iqbal presented the idea of a separate Muslim state that would geographically consist of the Muslim majority areas in the subcontinent. The word Pakistan is a conjunction of two words Pak meaning Pure and Stan meaning Land, a name coined by Choudhary Rahmat Ali.</p>
        <p class="text2">After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, it was expected that the British colonies would soon disintegrate. The Pakistan Movement, spearheaded by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, resulted in creating a Muslim state. Pakistan gained independence from the British rule on August 14, 1947. At its birth, Pakistan had two parts commonly referred to as East and West Pakistan. In 1971 East Pakistan parted from West Pakistan and became Bangladesh.</p>
